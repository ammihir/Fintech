To do this exercise, you need to refer to homework instructions of
setting up Amazon Lex, which is basically a finite set of instructions to 
execute a chat response. And then the LAMBDA functions are used to validate
the resonses

The lex is made up of slots, intents, and later the lambda function(python script) which needs to be copied.
